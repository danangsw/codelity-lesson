// A DNA sequence can be represented as a string consisting of the letters A, C, G and T, 
// which correspond to the types of successive nucleotides in the sequence. Each nucleotide has an impact factor, 
// which is an integer. Nucleotides of types A, C, G and T have impact factors of 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. 
// You are going to answer several queries of the form: What is the minimal impact factor of nucleotides contained in a particular part of the given DNA sequence?

// The DNA sequence is given as a non-empty string S = S[0]S[1]...S[N-1] consisting of N characters.
// There are M queries, which are given in non-empty arrays P and Q, each consisting of M integers.
// The K-th query (0 â‰¤ K < M) requires you to find the minimal impact factor of nucleotides contained in the DNA sequence between positions P[K] and Q[K] (inclusive).

// For example, consider string S = CAGCCTA and arrays P, Q such that:
//  P[0] = 2    Q[0] = 4
//  P[1] = 5    Q[1] = 5
//  P[2] = 0    Q[2] = 6

// The answers to these M = 3 queries are as follows:
// 1. The part of the DNA between positions 2 and 4 contains nucleotides G and C (twice), whose impact factors are 3 and 2 respectively, so the answer is 2.
// 2. The part between positions 5 and 5 contains a single nucleotide T, whose impact factor is 4, so the answer is 4.
// 3. The part between positions 0 and 6 (the whole string) contains all nucleotides, in particular nucleotide A whose impact factor is 1, so the answer is 1.
